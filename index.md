### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always liked blackjack so having the chance to make it with c++ was pretty cool.
  The process wasn't too hard or difficult either so it was an enjoyable experience. Also I enjoyed showing the lab to my family.

  Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1 was pretty cool because the bmr chart is something we all encounter at the doctors office. I do like calculating Kobe and The Rocks BMR.
  Also seeing how the chart works for bmr is interesting.

  Lab 1
    Lab 1, part 1 was really cool to experience knowing "Hello World!" is the first message written with code. It acts as a starting step to my coding education.
  It really does have a nice mix of mystery behind how coding and computers work.
